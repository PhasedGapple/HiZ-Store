# HiZ-Store
A store for Vidaa hisense tvs
### Status: WIP
###### Website:
	https://phasedgapple.github.io/HiZ-Store/
###### Make sure to visit this website on your Hisense TV browser else it wont work.

## Current Focus
I am currently focussing on those:
- Adding as many apps as possible requested by users
- Making it work on Modern TVs using a DNS method
- Adding custom app repo support

## This project is inspired by this blog:
  https://bananamafia.dev/post/hisensehax/


## TODO
- [ ] Add custom DNS to support modern VIDAA TVs
- [ ] Recreate site so it looks better for an App Store
- [x] Make it so I only need to add 1 line to add an app.
